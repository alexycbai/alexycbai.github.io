  Hi! I'm Alexander Bai (白与尘). Welcome to my Homepage.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently a freshman at Tufts University. During 20-21 academic year, I took
  classes at Peking University. I'm interested in Computer Science (especially programming
  languages though I know little about it) and philosophy (knowing very little about it too).
